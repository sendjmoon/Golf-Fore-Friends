    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <hr class="landing-bar">
    <p><strong><em>Golf Four Friends</em></strong> is dedicated to helping golfers stay connected with the game and each other. We all love (or hate) looking at scorecards but saving those cards isn't terribly convenient. Well, we're here to mitigate that burden and give players the opportunity to record and review said scores.</p>
